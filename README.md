To-Do List App or Website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In this To-Do list we should have the next possibilities:
- to add a task list and mark that task as "completed" or "incompleted".
- to write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
- to push a "close" icon to delete the particular task from the ToDo list.

Local Storage has been used in this project to make a possibility to store the task list or To-Do list in your web browser. In this case, after closing or restarting a browser your to-do list will be displayed in the last saved state.
